# Rebuild context paths plugin

A plugin that supports the rebuilding of context paths.  Note this different to built-in functionality as build_all_paths() is called with 'TRUE' as first parameter to always force the rebuild.

##### Installation

This plugin should be installed into the local/rebuildcontextpaths directory.

##### Configuration

There is a cron task that is set to execute each day at 0500.  This should be customised as necessary or disabled entirely (for manual use only).
